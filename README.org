* Setup .git in a different directory

To prevent the whole =$HOME= to be recognized as a huge repo, use:
#+begin_src bash
alias dotfiles='git --git-dir=$HOME/.dotfiles/ --work-tree=../'
#+end_src

But magit won't detect the repo in this case. To enable it temporarily, add a new file:
#+begin_src bash
echo 'gitdir: $HOME/dotfiles/' > .git
#+end_src

* vim
Vim config files are stored under =vimfiles= for Windows and =.vim= for Linux.
